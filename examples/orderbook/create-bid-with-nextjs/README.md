This example application demonstrates how to create a bid using the Immutable SDK. The application connects to the Immutable Sandbox environment and requires a valid client ID and publishable API key (which can be retrieved from the Immutable Hub).

In order to create a bid, a valid ERC721 or ERC1155 token must be provided. The application will prompt the user to connect their Passport wallet and approve the token. Once the token is approved, a bid with the desired price and quantity is created.

## Features
- Create a bid for an ERC721 token
- Create a bid for an ERC1155 token

## Prerequisites
- Node.js

## Getting Started
1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Replace the `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` with your own values from the Immutable Hub.


4. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and you'll be navigated to the home screen.
