# Example Apps Documentation Generator
## Task Overview
Analyze all example apps in the /examples/contracts/ directory and create documentation files for each example app that doesn't already have them. For each example app, you will create:
1. A comprehensive tutorial.md file
2. A metadata.json file

## Preparation
Before starting:
- Read through all SDK documentation (in the /sdk and /packages folders)
- Understand the SDK's key features, functionality, and integration patterns

## Process for Each Example App
For each subdirectory in /examples/contr/ that doesn't already have both tutorial.md and metadata.json:

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Read all code files in the example app directory
- Identify which SDK features are being demonstrated
- Understand the app's architecture, components, and data flow
- Note all frameworks, libraries, and dependencies used

### 2. Create tutorial.md
Create a tutorial.md file in the example app's root with the following structure:

#### Introduction
- Brief overview of the app's purpose
- Which specific SDK capabilities it demonstrates
- Link to the example app's GitHub repository

#### Features Overview (REMEMBER THAT INITIALIZING THE ORDERBOOK/CHECKOUT/CONTRACTS/PASSPORT SDK IS NOT A FEATURE)
- Bulleted list of all SDK features demonstrated in this example app

> IMPORTANT: Focus on how the example app uses each feature. Do NOT include Orderbook/Checkout/Contracts/Passport SDK initialization and Orderbook/Checkout/Contracts/Passport Provider Creation instructions - focus only on the example-specific implementation details.
#### SDK Integration Details
For each SDK feature shown in the example:
- **Link**: Reference to the specific file in the GitHub repository
- **Feature Name**: Brief description of what the feature does
- **Implementation**: Code snippets showing how the feature is implemented
- **Explanation**: Clear explanation of how the code works


#### Running the App
- Link to the example app's GitHub repository
- Prerequisites (including a link to Immutable Hub for environment setup)
- Step-by-step instructions to run the app locally(use pnpm not npm)

#### Summary
- Concise recap of what was demonstrated
- Any key takeaways for developers

#### Formatting Requirements
- Use proper Markdown syntax throughout
- Use heading levels (H1, H2, H3) appropriately
- Format all code with proper syntax highlighting
- Use bulleted lists for features and steps

### 3. Create metadata.json
Create a metadata.json file in the example app's root with the following structure:
{
"title": "[Descriptive title of the example app]",
"description": "[Concise overview of what the example app demonstrates]",
"keywords": ["Immutable", "SDK", "[Feature1]", "[Feature2]", "..."],
"tech_stack": ["[Framework]", "[Library]", "..."],
"product": "[Passport/Checkout/Orderbook/etc]",
"programming_language": "[TypeScript/JavaScript/etc]"
}


### 4. Handling Existing Files
If either tutorial.md or metadata.json already exists but is incomplete:
- Enhance the content while preserving any accurate existing information
- Ensure it meets all the format requirements specified above

## Final Verification for Each Example App
Before moving to the next example app, verify:
- All SDK features in the example app are documented in tutorial.md
- The tutorial is free of generic SDK initialization boilerplate
- All links to GitHub repositories are correct
- metadata.json contains accurate and comprehensive information
- Both files are properly formatted
