# Immutable preset contract examples

These examples demonstrate ways of interacting with the [Immutable preset contracts](https://docs.immutable.com/products/zkEVM/contracts).

Immutable provides a set of preset contracts than can be used by customers to deploy known, battle-tested contracts to the zkEVM.

Immutable's preset contracts are equipped with features purpose-built for Web3 gaming, simplifying the integration process with Immutable's zkEVM platform.

The [contracts library](https://github.com/immutable/contracts) contains smart contract presets that can also be used to import Typescript ABIs that can be used directly with modern libraries like `abitype`, `viem` and `wagmi`.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Test the examples:

```
