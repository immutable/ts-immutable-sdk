## Immutable Passport SDK Example App Generator - Part 2: Adding or Updating {feature name}

### Usage Instructions
This prompt helps you:
1. Add a new feature implementation to an existing example app
2. Update an existing feature implementation
3. Safely handle manually edited code

**IMPORTANT**: Before running this prompt:
- If the feature file contains the comment `/* MANUALLY EDITED - DO NOT OVERWRITE */`, the prompt will alert you before making changes
- To add a new feature, specify the feature name that doesn't exist yet
- To update a feature, specify the existing feature name to be updated

### Initial Analysis
1. Check if `src/app/{feature name}/page.tsx` already exists:
   - If it exists, look for the `/* MANUALLY EDITED - DO NOT OVERWRITE */` comment
   - If manually edited, alert the engineer and request confirmation before proceeding
   - If not manually edited or if confirmation received, proceed with update
   - If it doesn't exist, prepare to create a new implementation

2. Identify integration points with the existing app:
   - Check for navigation components that need updating
   - Verify any shared state or context requirements
   - Identify any dependencies in the existing codebase

3. Read the complete Passport SDK documentation for the {feature name} feature at https://docs.immutable.com/docs/zkEVM/products/passport.

IMPORTANT: We have an internal UI Library called Biom3. Make sure that you thoroughly understand all of the components. DON'T ASSUME that a component exists. ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE YOU IMPORT OR USE ANYTHING
IF THE COMPONENT THAT YOU WANT DOESN'T EXIST IN BIOM3, ALWAYS USE NORMAL CSS/HTML AND NEVER ASSUME. (https://github.com/immutable/biom3 | https://immutable.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/2335965298/BIOME+Docs)

### Implementation Strategy
1. For NEW feature implementation:
   - Create `src/app/{feature name}/page.tsx` with the 'use client' directive
   - Import all necessary components and SDK elements
   - Implement the feature with proper error handling, loading states, and UI
   - Update any navigation components to include the new feature (if applicable)
   - Listen to additional {feature name} specific requirements given by the user via the chat window
   - Ensure that Passport login/wallet connect is implemented properly. If not sure, refer to other Passport example apps for reference.

2. For UPDATING existing implementation:
   - Preserve any custom imports or components specific to the app
   - Update SDK-related code with the latest implementation
   - Maintain the existing UI structure while updating functionality
   - Preserve any custom logic that extends beyond the standard implementation

3. For any implementation:
   - Verify all SDK objects before use: `if (!passportInstance) return;`
   - Use optional chaining: `instance?.method?.()`
   - Wrap SDK calls in try/catch with appropriate error handling
   - Display meaningful error messages to users
   - Track and display loading states

### Feature Implementation Requirements
1. Use only documented methods and properties that exist on the SDK
2. Follow exact method signatures for all calls
3. Type all variables properly with TypeScript
4. Properly handle component lifecycle and cleanup
5. Implement event listeners with proper typing and cleanup (when applicable)
6. Structure UI with semantic HTML and Biom3 components
7. Implement clear loading, success, and error states

### Code Quality Checklist
- [ ] All SDK objects checked for existence before use
- [ ] All async operations wrapped in try/catch
- [ ] Event listeners properly removed in cleanup functions
- [ ] No references to unmounted components
- [ ] Integration with existing app navigation/state (if applicable)
- [ ] Proper TypeScript typing on all variables and functions
- [ ] React State hooks must be used appropriately, e.g. state updates must be handled correctly. e.g. on successful logins, loading must be set to false.

## Feature Management

### Adding New Features
To add a new feature implementation to this example app:
1. Run the {feature name} generator prompt
2. Specify the new feature name when prompted
3. The generator will create a new feature implementation at `src/app/{feature name}/page.tsx`
4. Update any navigation components to include the new feature

### Updating Features
To update an existing feature implementation:
1. Run the {feature name} generator prompt
2. Specify the existing feature name to update
3. The generator will update the implementation while preserving app-specific customizations

### Protecting Manual Edits
If you've made manual edits to a feature implementation that you want to protect:
1. Add the comment `/* MANUALLY EDITED - DO NOT OVERWRITE */` at the top of the file
2. The generator will alert you before overwriting manually edited files
```

This comprehensive guide will help you safely add or update feature implementations while respecting existing code and manual edits.
