## Features Overview

- **Wallet Connection**: Connect to users' wallets through Immutable Passport
- **Transaction Execution**: Execute ERC-721 token transfers on Immutable zkEVM

## SDK Integration Details

### Wallet Connection

**Feature Name**: Connect to a user's Ethereum wallet through Passport.

**Source Code**: [Source code file](https://github.com/immutable/ts-immutable-sdk/blob/main/examples/passport/wallets-transactions-with-nextjs/src/transaction.ts)

**Implementation**:

```typescript
const provider = await passportInstance.connectEvm();
const browserProvider = new BrowserProvider(provider);
const signer = await browserProvider.getSigner();
const [userAddress] = await provider.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });
```

**Explanation**: 
The application uses Passport's `connectEvm()` method to establish a connection to the user's wallet. This method returns a provider that can be used with ethers.js. The code then creates a BrowserProvider using this provider, gets a signer for transactions, and retrieves the user's Ethereum address.

### Transaction Execution

**Feature Name**: Execute smart contract transactions (ERC-721 token transfer).

**Source Code**: [Source code file](https://github.com/immutable/ts-immutable-sdk/blob/main/examples/passport/wallets-transactions-with-nextjs/src/transaction.ts)

**Implementation**:

```typescript
const abi = ['function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)'];
const contract = new ethers.Contract(erc721Address, abi, signer);

try {
  tx = await contract.safeTransferFrom(userAddress, toAddress, tokenId);
  // Wait for the transaction to complete
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
} catch (error: any) {
  // Handle errors
}
```

**Explanation**: 
The application demonstrates how to interact with an ERC-721 smart contract for transferring NFTs. It creates a contract instance using ethers.js, then calls the `safeTransferFrom` method to transfer a token from the user's address to another address. The code also includes error handling and transaction receipt verification.

## Running the App

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js and pnpm installed
2. An account on [Immutable Hub](https://hub.immutable.com/) for obtaining API keys
3. A created testnet collection with minted tokens on Immutable zkEVM

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_from_hub
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_hub
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TO_ADDRESS=address_to_send_nft_to
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ERC721_ADDRESS=your_testnet_collection_address
   NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ID=token_id_to_send
   ```

### Installation and Startup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Using the App

1. Click the "Send Transaction" button
2. Complete the Passport authentication flow if not already logged in
3. Approve the transaction in your connected wallet
4. The app will handle the transaction and show the result

## Summary

This example demonstrates the integration of Immutable Passport's wallet connection and transaction execution capabilities within a Next.js application. By following this tutorial, developers can implement wallet connections and execute blockchain transactions in their own applications, allowing for seamless interaction with the Immutable zkEVM ecosystem.
