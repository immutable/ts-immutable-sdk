## Immutable Passport SDK Example App Generator - Part 3: Styling {feature name}

### Usage Instructions
This prompt helps you:
1. Review other example apps' styling to establish a consistent visual standard
2. Update the existing {feature name} example app's styling (UI/UX) to match this standard
3. Implement Biom3 UI Library components correctly and consistently

### Setup and Resources
1. First, locate other example apps in the codebase to use as reference:
   - Navigate to the examples/ directory to find other feature implementations
   - Open at least 2-3 other example apps to compare their styling approaches

2. Access Biom3 UI Library documentation:
   - GitHub: https://github.com/immutable/biom3
   - Internal docs: https://immutable.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DS/pages/2335965298/BIOME+Docs
   - Note which components are commonly used across example apps

### Styling Audit Checklist
Systematically review the {feature name} example app against these specific criteria:

1. **Layout and Structure**
   - Container widths and responsive behavior
   - Spacing between sections and components (margin/padding)
   - Alignment of elements (left/center/right)
   - Overall page structure and component organization

2. **Typography**
   - Font families, sizes, and weights
   - Text colors and contrast
   - Heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
   - Text alignment and line spacing

3. **Color Usage**
   - Primary, secondary, and accent colors
   - Background colors
   - Border colors
   - Consistent use of the Immutable color palette

4. **Component Implementation**
   - Button styles, sizes, and variants
   - Form elements (inputs, selects, checkboxes)
   - Card and container components
   - Navigation elements

5. **Interactive Elements**
   - Hover, active, and focus states
   - Loading states and animations
   - Error and success states
   - Transitions and micro-interactions

### Implementation Process
1. For each inconsistency identified in the audit:
   - Document the specific issue
   - Find the corresponding implementation in reference apps
   - Note which Biom3 component should be used (if applicable)

2. Prioritize changes:
   - First address structural/layout issues
   - Then implement Biom3 components to replace custom styling
   - Finally refine spacing, typography, and visual details

3. For each Biom3 component implementation:
   - Check the documentation for proper usage
   - Review how other example apps implement the same component
   - Ensure props and variants match the established pattern

### Documentation and Validation
1. Create a brief summary of changes made:
   - Components replaced or updated
   - Major styling modifications
   - Any deviations from other examples (with justification)

2. Final validation:
   - Compare side-by-side with other example apps
   - Verify responsive behavior across different screen sizes
   - Ensure accessibility standards are maintained

### Final Check
Go through the entire {feature name} example app one more time and compare with other example apps for consistency. If inconsistencies remain, revisit the audit checklist and address each item until the styling is fully aligned with other examples.
