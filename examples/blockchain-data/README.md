# Blockchain Data API Examples

These examples demonstrate ways of implementing the methods exposed by the blockchainData package of `@imtbl/sdk`, in order to interact with Immutable's [Blockchain Data APIs](https://docs.immutable.com/products/zkEVM/blockchain-data).

Immutable's Blockchain Data APIs index on-chain state changes and off-chain metadata to allow developers to efficiently retrieve information from Immutable's rollups.

## Getting Started

Pre-requisites:

- Node.js 20.0.0 or higher
