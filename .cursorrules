# Cursor Rules for Immutable SDK

## Conventional Commits

Always use conventional commit format for all commits and PR titles:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit

### Scope Guidelines
- **IMPORTANT**: Scopes should match the names of packages in the repo (without the `@imtbl/` prefix)
- Examples of valid scopes: `checkout-widgets`, `passport`, `config`, `blockchain-data`, etc.
- Find the correct scope by checking the package.json `name` field in the relevant package directory
- Use the full package name after `@imtbl/` (e.g., if package is `@imtbl/checkout-widgets`, use `checkout-widgets`)

### Examples
- `feat(checkout-widgets): update price impact warning message`
- `fix(passport): resolve token validation error`
- `docs(config): add installation instructions`
- `refactor(blockchain-data): simplify token formatting logic`

### PR Title Guidelines
- Use the same conventional commit format for PR titles
- Keep titles under 50 characters when possible
- Use lowercase for the description
- Be descriptive but concise
- **ALWAYS** include the scope matching the package name (without `@imtbl/` prefix)

### Commit Message Guidelines
- Use imperative mood in the subject line ("add" not "added" or "adding")
- Capitalize the first letter of the description
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- Wrap the body at 72 characters

When creating PRs, always follow this conventional commit style for both the commit messages and PR titles.

## Principles
The following list of principles should be honoured when introducing changes:
- always check what's the best practice in the industry
- raise with the user if there is a package out there that is a 80-90% fit instead of writing from scratch
- always clean up after changes
- focus on root cause instead of fixing symptoms
- trace changes applied locally and in-branch against main when debugging issues locally to first understand if it's a pre-existing bug
- do not come up with new requirements or alter requirements by yourself. Propose alternatives first.
- follow the same architecture pattern in the repo. If there is significant benefit to do things differently, raise it first.
- when refactoring, check if any existing functionality has been changed/broken or new functionality has been added. if inevertible, call it out.
- always check if changes have introduced any bugs
- when coming up with a fix, keep going after the first layer of root cause until you can reason about the entire data flow/userflow is sound.
